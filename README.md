Bull Cow Game Initial Commit

This is a simple word game where the program picks a word randomly, commits it to memory
and provides the player a set amount of tries to guess the word.  Game difficulty relies on
the word length so the program determines max tries based on word length.

I recently added the randomization code and there is a bug at that point that made the program
display max tries and word length incorrectly.

Thanks for looking.
